# WIld Oasis

Introducing an exquisite hotel admin panel that is bound to impress!
Built on React, this admin panel leverages the power of Supabase for the backend, ensuring robust and secure data management. React Query facilitates efficient data fetching and caching, while React Router enables smooth navigation within the application. The UI is beautifully crafted using Styled Components, ensuring a visually appealing and engaging interface.

With features like React Hook Form and React Error Boundary, I guarantee an enhanced user experience, enabling effortless data entry and graceful error handling. Additionally, I have integrated Recharts, a powerful data visualization library, to provide comprehensive insights and analytics for effective business decision-making.
